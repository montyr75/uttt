# Welcome to Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe! 🎮

Get ready for a strategic twist on the classic game! Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a massive 3x3 grid, where each square is its *own* smaller Tic-Tac-Toe board.

**The Goal:** Win three small boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to claim victory on the main board!

## How to Play

*   **Start the Game:** Player X goes first and can place their mark in **any** open square on **any** of the nine small boards.
*   **The Golden Rule:** Your move determines where your opponent plays next!
    *   *Example:* If you place your mark in the **top-right** square of a small board, your opponent *must* make their next move somewhere in the **top-right** small board.
*   **Winning a Board:** Get three of your symbols in a row on a small board to win it. That entire board becomes yours and is marked with your big symbol.

## Special Situations

*   **Free Move:** If you are sent to a board that has already been won or is completely full, you get a **Free Move**! This means you can play in any open square on any active board.
*   **Draws:** If a small board fills up without a winner, it counts as a tie for that specific board.

Think ahead, block your opponent, and conquer the grid!
